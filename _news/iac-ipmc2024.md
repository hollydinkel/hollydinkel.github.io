Throughout 2024, I studied space commercialization by analyzing public corporate financial data for commercial space companies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. This was a big effort by my team: [Luca Ferrone](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/luca-ferrone), [Shinsuke Kito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shinsukekito/), [Giulia Cambone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulia-cambone-075723210), [Antonio Stark](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/antoniofowlstark), and [Chawalwat Martkamjan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chawalwat-martkamjan/). During the course of the project I also grew accustomed to 2:00AM calls to meet workday meeting timezones for CEOs in Asia!
