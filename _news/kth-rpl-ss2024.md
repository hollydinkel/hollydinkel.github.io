I spent the most fun week of my Ph.D. at the Happy Tammsvik conference hotel in Bro, Sweden where I participated in the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology Division of Robotics, Perception, and Learning Summer School](https://summer-school.rpl.eecs.kth.se/programme/). This experience fostered lasting collaborations and deepened my appreciation for the robotics innovations emerging from Europe.
