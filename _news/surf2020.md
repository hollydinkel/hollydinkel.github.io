title: I was a 2020 Stanford U.S. Russia Forum Delegate in Space Cooperation and presented our research at the IAF GLEX Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º

During the 2020-2021 academic year, I was a space cooperation delegate in the Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum. Over the course of the year, I studied the emerging commercial space ecosystems in the U.S. and Russia along with [Jason Cornelius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-k-cornelius) and [Arzu Kurgan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arzukurgan/). We all traveled to St. Petersburg, Russia to present our work at the IAF Global Space Exploration Conference (GLEX) where it was a finalist for the Best Technical Presentation award! This was also the first conference I ever attended that used a palace as the venue!
