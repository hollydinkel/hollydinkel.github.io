title: I received the 2023 P.E.O. Scholar Award
---

P.E.O. International is a philanthropic organization with a mission of helping women help women. While completing a masterâ€™s degree at Stanford, I reached out to [Barbara Tonn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-tonn-71b7158), my coworker at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and a member of the Huntsville P.E.O. Chapter. Barbara helped me obtain a low interest rate loan from P.E.O. to help fund my graduate studies. Once I learned more about P.E.O., I focused on their highest honor, the P.E.O. Scholar Award, presented to women selected through a highly competitive application process during the final two years of their doctoral programs. [Finally earning the award](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/news/54710) felt like delayed gratification that I had truly earned! I was equally delighted to support my friend, [Julia Di](https://www.juliadi.com/), as she applied for and received the same award the following year, too! I happily share my [PEO Scholar Award Academic Program and Proposal Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnbxIId1IWr8rvBCP1phX-AJp0CTn11T/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111203983467990552380&rtpof=true&sd=true) and my [PEO Scholar Award Background Information Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LkcEmKePxCKpnYkvymXX6szdpQYZGHFz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111203983467990552380&rtpof=true&sd=true) and **strongly** encourage other women pursuing the Ph.D. in robotics-related fields to apply!
