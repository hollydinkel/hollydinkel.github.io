title: I was awarded a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity for 2021-2025

[I was awarded a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/news/43380) for 2021-2025! This award allowed me to pursue my self-directed research on representing and manipulating deformable linear objects in partnership with NASA. Perks include Visiting Technologist Experiences at NASA research centers which have a research match with my topic, regular check-ins with NASA robotics researchers to gain additional feedback on project directions, and budget for materials and travel.
