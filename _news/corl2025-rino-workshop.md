title: I co-organized the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025 RINO Workshop in Seoul, Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·
---

I co-organized a Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) 2025 workshop! The workshop is [**Beyond Rigid Worlds: Representing and Interacting with Nonâ€‘Rigid Objects (RINO)**](https://rino-workshop.github.io). This year CoRL accepted only 42% of the proposed workshops, and its reputation continues to grow as a leading venue for embodied intelligence--it currently [ranks #18 in AI overall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence), and it would rank [#3 in robotics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_robotics) by h5-index if categorized accordingly. This workshop aimed to build connections among top talent and leaders in robotics and AI to develop the academic and industry ecosystem around robotic interaction with non-rigid objects.

It was fun to co-organize this conference with an all-star team of Ph.D. students and Postdoctoral Scholars from all around the world, many of whom I first met at previous global robotics events (e.g., the [KTH RPL Summer School](https://summer-school.rpl.eecs.kth.se/) and the IEEE ICRA [Deformables Workshops](https://github.com/deformable-workshop)). Thank you to [Marcel BÃ¼sching](https://buesma.github.io/), [Jad Abou-Chakra](https://jadchakra.github.io/), [Alessio Caporali](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/alessio.caporali/cv-en), [Bardienus Duisterhof](https://www.bart-ai.com/), [Alberta Longhini](https://albilo17.github.io/), [Jens Lundell](https://jenslundell.ai/), [Priya Sundaresan](https://priyasundaresan.github.io/), [Mingrui Yu](https://mingrui-yu.github.io/), and [Kaifeng Zhang](https://kywind.github.io/) for making this event so great!
