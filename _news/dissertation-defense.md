title: I defended my Ph.D. dissertation
---

I defended my dissertation, "Representing and Manipulating Deformable Linear Objects." The [raw recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff0a62h3UrA) and the [dissertation pre-print](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r7gHWHW2pjzgisU_qMGzgNsFsd8_9uhw/view?usp=sharing) are available and will be updated with published versions soon! 

For Ph.D. candidates looking to defend, I recommend optimizing for impact and inviting everyone to your public session! I used [Luma](https://lu.ma/7m0w1lhc) to help organize invitations, update event details, and announce changes to attendees. I also used Zoom to share the event with a remote audience and record the presentation.
