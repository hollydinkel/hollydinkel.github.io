title: I led a team to first prize in the OpenCV AI competition
---

The [Illinois COCONuts won first prize in the Core Track of the 2022 OpenCV AI Competition](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/news/57521)! This put us in the [top 7 of 45 teams](https://opencv.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/OpenCV-AI-Competition-2022-%E2%80%93-Core-OpenCV-Track-Winners-1.pdf) internationally! We developed a generalizable procedure for creating instance-aware wire detectors, since thin wires are typically challenging to detect using existing object detectors and conventional techniques from computer vision. Check out our pipeline below!
