title: I chaired the Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking sessions at the AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting in LÄ«huÊ»e, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

I attended the AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics meeting in LÄ«huÊ»e, Kaua'i, Hawai'i since [Su Yeon Choi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/su-yeon-choi-9529b51b5/) and I teamed up to prepare her [Multi-IMU Sensor Fusion](https://hollydinkel.github.io/assets/pdf/AAS2025.pdf) work there. I chaired two sessions on satellite Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking (RPOD) while there. Future free-flying robots in space habitats definitely need to be experts at RPOD! We hope multi-IMU fusion can improve localization for these operations in the future too!
