title: I was a Young Professional delegate and Group Leader in the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) International Programme/Project Management Committee Young Professionals' Workshop in Baku, Azerbaijan ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿
---

The 2023 IAF IAC was geopolitically tense and sponsored an abbreviated version of the conventional IAF International Programme/Project Management Committee (IPMC) Young Professionals' (YP) workshop. I still learned a lot by spending the day discussing Human Capital Management with [Abdullah AlGarrash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-algharrash/), [Roxy Fournier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roxannefournier/), [Maximillian Kirchoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxi-kirchhoff/), and [Kishan Thakkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishan-thakkar-glx/)!
