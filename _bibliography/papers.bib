  abstract = {The TrackDLO algorithm estimates the shape of a Deformable Linear Object (DLO) under occlusion from a sequence of RGB-D images. TrackDLO is vision-only and runs in real-time. It requires no external state information from physics modeling, simulation, visual markers, or contact as input. The algorithm improves on previous approaches by addressing three common scenarios which cause tracking failure: tip occlusion, mid-section occlusion, and self-occlusion. This is achieved through the application of Motion Coherence Theory to impute the spatial velocity of occluded nodes, the use of the topological geodesic distance to track self-occluding DLOs, and the introduction of a non-Gaussian kernel that only penalizes lower-order spatial displacement derivatives to reflect DLO physics. Improved real-time DLO tracking under mid-section occlusion, tip occlusion, and self-occlusion is demonstrated experimentally. The source code and demonstration data are publicly released.},

    abstract = {This work presents an algorithm for tracking the shape of multiple entangling Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) from a sequence of RGB-D images. This algorithm runs in real-time and improves on previous single-DLO tracking approaches by enabling tracking of multiple objects. This is achieved using Global-Local Topology Preservation (GLTP). This work uses the geodesic distance in GLTP to define the distance between separate objects and the distance between different parts of the same object. Tracking multiple entangling DLOs is demonstrated experimentally. The source code is publicly released. },

    abstract = {The UN Office of Outer Space Affairs identifies synergy of space development activities and international cooperation through data and infrastructure sharing in their Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG17). Current multilateral space exploration paradigms, however, are divided between the Artemis and the Roscosmos-CNSA programs to return to the moon and establish permanent human settlements. As space agencies work to expand human presence in space, economic resource consolidation in pursuit of technologically ambitious space expeditions is the most sensible path to accomplish SDG17. This paper compiles a budget dataset for the top five federally-funded space agencies: CNSA, ESA, JAXA, NASA, and Roscosmos. Using time-series econometric anslysis methods in STATA, this work analyzes each agency's economic contributions toward space exploration. The dataset results are used to propose a multinational space mission, Vela, for the development of an orbiting space station around Mars in the late 2030s. Distribution of economic resources and technological capabilities by the respective space programs are proposed to ensure programmatic redundancy and increase the odds of success on the given timeline.},

    abstract = {This work analyzes progress and challenges in the development of commercial space economies in the United States and Russia. Space development progress is characterized through examination of three production indicators for the space economies in each country and econometric analysis of the financial data for three new American private space companies. We also provide case studies of major challenges faced by three new private space companies and conjecture about the future of the private space industry through analysis of space education projects in each country. As leaders of space technological development and exploration, the U.S. and Russia are major stakeholders in the current and future global space economy. We find access to capital is a primary barrier to entrepreneurship. The results will help future founders more effectively navigate the complex financial, regulatory, and technological landscape of the space industry.},

    abstract = {Perception of the shapes of deforming objects like wires enables their monitoring and manipulation by autonomous robots. This paper presents detection, classification, and instance segmentation of deformable wires from a cluttered scene in RGBD imagery. This work uses the Detectron2 implementation of Mask R-CNN trained with the PointRend mask head on the UIUCWires dataset as the framework for wire instance segmentation on RGB imagery, a method demonstrated to perform well for the instance segmentation task in previous work. In this work, the instance bitmask is directly used to segment individual object point clouds, an important step toward wire shape representation for manipulation tasks.},

Next-generation industrial automation will require both integration of distinct robotic technologies and their application to challenging industrial environments. This paper presents lessons from a collaborative assembly project between three academic research groups and an industry partner. The goal of the project is to develop a flexible, safe, and productive manufacturing cell for sub-centimeter precision assembly. Solving this problem in a high-mix, low-volume production line motivates multiple research thrusts in robotics. This work identifies new directions in collaborative robotics for industrial applications and offers insight toward strengthening collaborations between institutions in academia and industry on the development of new technologies.},
